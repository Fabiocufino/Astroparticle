# Blazars as Sources of Astrophysical Neutrino Flux

This repository contains the code for a presentation titled "Blazars as sources of astrophysical neutrino flux," specifically focusing on the neutrino emission from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 prior to the IceCube-170922A alert.

## Abstract

A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on September 22, 2017, coincided with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. This prompted a thorough analysis of 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino data to search for excess emission from this blazar. Significant findings include a 3.5Ïƒ evidence of neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056 between September 2014 and March 2015, suggesting blazars as the first identifiable sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.
