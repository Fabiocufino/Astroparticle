# Neutrino Emission from the Blazar TXS 0506+056 Prior to the IceCube-170922A Alert

## Overview

A high-energy neutrino event detected by the IceCube Observatory on September 22, 2017, was found to be coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. This prompted an investigation into 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino data to search for any prior neutrino emissions from this blazar.

## Key Findings

- **Neutrino Excess**: Analysis revealed an excess of high-energy neutrino events from the direction of TXS 0506+056 between September 2014 and March 2015. This excess, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, provides 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from this blazar, independent of the 2017 flare.
- **Significance**: The evidence suggests that blazars, like TXS 0506+056, are viable sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. The analysis conducted indicates that these emissions are consistent with time-variable flux.

## Background and Importance

- **High-Energy Cosmic Rays**: The origin of the highest-energy cosmic rays is believed to be extragalactic. Neutrinos are produced near cosmic ray acceleration sites and can travel through the universe without being deflected by magnetic fields, offering a direct way to study these extreme environments.
- **Blazars**: Blazars are active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets aimed close to our line of sight, making them prominent candidates for high-energy neutrino emission. Their electromagnetic emissions vary significantly over different time scales.

## IceCube Neutrino Observatory

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, comprises an array of optical sensors embedded within a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice. These sensors detect Cherenkov light from relativistic particles produced by neutrino interactions, allowing the reconstruction of the neutrino's direction with high precision.

## Analysis and Results

- **Data Span**: The analysis included data from April 2008 to October 2017. Different detector configurations and event selection criteria were applied throughout this period.
- **Time-Dependent Analysis**: Significant excess of neutrino events was found during the 2014-2015 period, centered around December 2014, with an estimated fluence of E²J = (2.1+0.9) × 10⁻⁴ TeV cm⁻² and a spectral index of γ = 2.1±0.2.
- **Time-Integrated Analysis**: Over the full 9.5-year dataset, the best-fitting parameters were Φ = (0.8+0.5) × 10⁻¹⁶ TeV⁻¹ cm⁻² s⁻¹ and γ = 2.0±0.3. Excluding the 2017 data, the significance was 2.1σ, dominated by the 2014-2015 excess.

## Implications

- **Neutrino Luminosity**: The estimated isotropic neutrino luminosity during the 2014-2015 period exceeds the gamma-ray luminosity, suggesting either absorption of gamma rays or emission outside the observed energy range.
- **Blazars as Neutrino Sources**: The results support the hypothesis that blazars can be significant sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, contributing to the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube.

## Conclusion

The investigation provides substantial evidence that the blazar TXS 0506+056 emitted high-energy neutrinos during a period prior to the well-documented 2017 event. This strengthens the case for blazars as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos and highlights the importance of multi-messenger astronomy in understanding these powerful astrophysical phenomena.
